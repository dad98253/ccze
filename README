This is a fork of CCZE, a fast log colorizer written in C, intended to be a
drop-in replacement for colorize (http://colorize.raszi.hu).

See the NEWS file for a description of recent changes to CCZE.

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install the
CCZE data and program files. See the CCZE manual for details about
configuration. Type "man ccze" in the shell prompt.

Please visit the official CCZE web page for more information. The URL

====================================================================================
This fork adds a plugin to permit the colorizing of DXSpider logs.
At present, it colorizes the chanerr debug output. 

To use it with your DXSpider server, open a DXSpider console and enter:

unset/debug nologchan
set/debug chanerr

Then, log in as a normal user on a virtual consol or open an xterm window and
enter the following:

watchdbg -2 chanerr | ccze

ccze will recognize the DXSpider log file format and colorize the output from watchdbg.
If you are using a slow computer, your can slightly reduce ccze cpu workload by specifying
the appropriate ccze plugin. There are two DXSpider plugins and you will generally want
run with them both loaded: DXSpider and DXSpiderPCxx. Enter:

watchdbg -2 chanerr | ccze --plugin=DXSpider,DXSpiderPCxx

Note, As of March 2023, the watchdbg application provided with the mojo version of DXSpider
buffers its output. Thus, if you wish to pipe its output to ccze in real time, you will need
to make a one line change to /spider/perl/watchdbg. Near line 52, add the command

STDOUT->autoflush(1);

to automatically flush the standard output buffer:
